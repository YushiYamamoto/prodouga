## ‚ö†Ô∏è How to keep good performance?

If you make some changes (for example image) - make sure image is saved as .WEBP & its small! - avoid large images, because performance will drop!
use https://tinypng.com/ to reduce you'r images

## üöÄ Static Media

There are 3 folders

-   fonts
-   images
-   icons

every of those folders have index.ts where you can find import / export files + for images and icons, we create special components

# üíª Sitemap & robots.tsx & SEO

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è

Change links & add all your pages into sitemap.cjs to have better SEO optimization!

search for ‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGEME ‚ö†Ô∏è in files & replace all instances

Seo: search for "YOUR META DESCRIPTION FOR SEO" and change this with your meta description of page - you can change it for all websites

## üñºÔ∏è Images

Images can be stored in static/images and use it with srcLocal (typescript will give you types),
also Image component can be display with "custom" link - use src instead of scrLocal:

```
  <Image src="logo" alt="logo" width="50px" height="50px" />
```

To register new image check the images object and add image there

## üé® Icons

icons are stored in static/icons and use it with iconData (typescript will give you types)

```
  <Icon iconData="home" alt="home" />
```

To register new icon check the icons object and add icon there

Use those components for media to keep best performance or in astro files use images from astro - also good!

## üöÄ Styles

All global styles like, colors, fonts, normalize or things like mediaQuery are stored in styles folder,

MediaQuery can be used with MIN & MAX OR BETWEEN - that means code will display depends on what we need to do:

```
    @returns @media example: (min-width: 768px)
    ${MediaQuery.min(breakpoint)} {
        //code
    }
```

```
    @returns @media example: (min-width: 768px)
    ${MediaQuery.max(breakpoint)} {
        //code
    }
```

```
    @returns @media example: (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px)
    ${MediaQuery.between("breakpoint1", "breakpoint2")} {
        //code
    }
```
